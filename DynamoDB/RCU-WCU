RCU – Read Capacity Unit
Each 1 RCU allows:

1 strongly consistent read per second, for items up to 4 KB in size

OR

2 eventually consistent reads per second, for items up to 4 KB

👉 So if you're reading a 6 KB item with strong consistency, it’ll use 2 RCUs per read because it exceeds the 4 KB chunk.

Example: You want to read 100 items per second, each 2 KB in size, eventually consistent:

100 reads × 0.5 RCUs = 50 RCUs

✍️ WCU – Write Capacity Unit
Each 1 WCU allows:

1 write per second for items up to 1 KB in size

👉 So, if you write an item that’s 2 KB, it takes 2 WCUs per write.

Example: You want to write 100 items per second, each 2 KB in size:

100 writes × 2 WCUs = 200 WCUs
