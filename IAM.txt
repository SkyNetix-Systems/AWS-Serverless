Policy (The Rules)
------------------
A JSON document that defines permissions (what actions are allowed or denied).
Policies are attached to users, groups, or roles to grant specific AWS actions.

Permissions (What You Can Do)
-----------------------------
The actual allowed or denied actions on AWS resources.
Permissions are controlled by policies attached to IAM users, groups, or roles.

Roles (Temporary Permissions)
-----------------------------
A set of permissions assigned to an entity (AWS services, users, or applications).
IAM roles don't require passwords or access keys.
Instead, AWS services assume roles using temporary security credentials (STS - Security Token Service).

Policy = "You can read files in S3" ðŸ“œ
Permission = "You are allowed to do it" âœ…
Role = "EC2 can temporarily assume permissions to access S3"
